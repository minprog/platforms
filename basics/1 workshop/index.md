# Setting up your development environment

Let's get you set up for developing without an online IDE. Having a complete development environment will allow you to reduce waiting times, to develop while offline, and to be less dependent on freely provided online services.

We will provide instructions for setting everything up on Mac and Windows. If you are on Linux, you most likely already have installed most of what you need. But feel free to reach out to the staff to double-check that you are OK!
