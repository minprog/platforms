## Requirements

Alright, now it's time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage
about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The
subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you,
subject to the following requirements:

- Your website must contain at least four different `.html` pages, and it
  should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by
  following one or more hyperlinks.
- Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least
  one table, and at least one image.
- Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
- Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at
  least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the `#id` selector
  at least once, and the `.class` selector at least once.
- You must use Bootstrap 5.1 on your website, taking advantage of at least one
  Bootstrap [component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/),
  and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using
  Bootstrap's [grid model](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/).
- Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of
  SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
- In `README.md`, include a short writeup describing your project, what's
  contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the
  staff should know about your project.
- Images may not be larger than 1MB.

Note that not all of the above requirements are covered in the [html lecture](/basics/html), some will
be introduced in the [git lecture](/basics/git).

## Tips

- You can view your webpages offline by opening the `.html` files with your web browser.

- Under WSL on Windows, you can open up `.html` files by either right-clicking them from within Visual Studio Code and then by clicking `open in explorer`. Or by running `explorer.exe .` in the terminal. Both methods open up the Windows File Explorer and from there you can open the html files in your browser.

- In the CS50 IDE, you can start a server to view the site by running

      $ http-server

  in the terminal window and clicking on the link that appears.

## How to Submit

Zip your stuff (make sure that images are not >1MB!).
