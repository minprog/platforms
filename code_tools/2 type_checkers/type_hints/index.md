# Type hints in Python

<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">Type hints</summary>
A type hint in the simplest form looks like this:


    foo: int


All this says is, the type of the variable `foo` should be an integer. Notice how there is no initial value here. This line of code does not create a variable `foo`, all it does is add a hint that `foo`, once it exists, should be an integer. That means this will raise a `NameError`:


    $ python3
    >>> foo: int
    >>> foo
    NameError: name 'foo' is not defined


It is possible to combine type hints and initialization on the same line, like so:


    foo: int = 3


That looks somewhat redundant, doesn't it? How can the *literal* value `3` be anything else than an integer? This is where type inference kicks in. Tools will try to infer the types of variables from their use. It is quite safe to assume type inference is possible here, so probably best to just write:


    foo = 3


Type inference does have its limitations, for instance `mypy`, a popular static type checker for Python, will not do any type inference in functions without type hints. To understand why, let's quickly look into function type hints. In the simplest form:


    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        c = a + b
        return c


The syntax above is straight forward, use the colon (`:`) for parameter type hints, and the arrow (`->`) for the return type. Notice how the type of `c` is not annotated. It can be, but it is not needed. From the types of `a` and `b` and the `+` operation, `mypy` can infer the type of `c`. But what if we did not annotate this function. Well, in that case, `a` and `b` could be anything: `str`, `float`, `list`, you name it! This is where `mypy` draws a line, if you do not annotate a function, `mypy` will not even attempt to do type inference. Instead all variables will be of type `Any`.

What is `Any`? Well, anything really. It is an escape hatch of sorts that provides no information. Once `Any` gets involved type checking becomes rather impossible. What is `Any + int`? `Any`.

1. Annotate the `factorial` function below by adding as many type hints as needed:


        def factorial(num):
            total = 1
            for i in range(2, num + 1):
                total *= i
            return total

<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">Generics</summary>

Integers, floats, booleans and strings are primitive data types. Built into the language, they serve as building blocks for more complex data structures. For instance, you might need a `list` to store your data. 


    numbers: list = [1, 2, 3]
    number = numbers.pop()


Here is the catch, the type `list` does not tell *anything* about what is in the `list`. So really what we have here is a `list` containing `Any`. In this case the type of `number` would be `Any` too.

A `list` is a generic data type. It can store various types, but its operation will vary based on what you store. Simply put for a `list`, if you initially store integers in the list, you will later be able to retrieve integers from that list. This can be annotated as follows:


    numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]
    number = numbers.pop()


Now `numbers` is defined as a list of integers, and through that `number` will be of type `int` too.

Let's take a quick look at `dict`. Dictionaries have two types, their keys and values. This is how that can be annotated:


    grades: dict[str, int] = {"Martijn": 7, "Marleen": 8}


Tuples are an immutable data structure, once initialized it cannot be changed. So it is known up front exactly what the type of each value in the tuple is going to be. Because of this the `tuple` type can a variable amount of generic anotations with exactly as many types as there are values. Like so:

    foo: tuple[int, float] = (7, 7.2)
    bar: tuple[int, float, str] = (8, 7.9, "hello world")
    baz: tuple[int, int, int] = (1, 2, 3)


What about nested data structures?


    stats: dict[str, tuple[int, float]] = {"Martijn": (7, 7.2), "Marleen": (8, 8.1)}


Again, in most situations `mypy` can infer the types of the variables, and it is not strictly needed to annotate each data structure for type checking. That said, especially when it comes to data structures, annotations make the code easier to understand.

2. Annotate the data structures below:

        
        foo = ["hello", "world"]
    

    <textarea name="form[q2.1]" rows="1" required=""></textarea>

        
        bar = [("Martijn", 1), ("Marleen", 2)]
    

    <textarea name="form[q2.2]" rows="1" required=""></textarea>

        
        baz = {1: {2: {3: "hello"}}}
    

    <textarea name="form[q2.3]" rows="1" required=""></textarea>

<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">Type variables</summary>

How do you write your own generic functions? In Python that requires type variables. These are provided by `TypeVar` from the `typing` module. Here is how it works:


    from typing import TypeVar

    T = TypeVar('T')  # Can be anything
    N = TypeVar('N', int, float)  # Must be int or float


Type variables can be unconstrained, like `T` above. In this case `T` can be any type at all. Or type variables can be constraint, like `N` above. In which case `N` can only be an `int` or a `float`. Type variables can come in place of actual types to create for instance generic functions:


    from typing import Iterable, TypeVar

    T = TypeVar('T')

    def first(items: list[T]) -> T:
        return items[0]


`first` will return the first item in the list, but what type is returned is dependent on the list. For instance, if `first` is called like so:


    n = first([1,2,3])


Then `n` will be of type `int`. Because a `list[int]` is passed in and `T` will take on the form of `int`. `T` is what is ultimately returned from `first` and that is then why `n` is an `int`.

Type variables can be used outside generic data structures too, for instance:


    def longest(a: T, b: T) -> T:
        return a if len(a) >= len(b) else b


This function will work for any type T, and it will return that same type.

3. Annotate the generic function below with a type variable:

        
        def repeat(x, n):
            return [x] * n

## Abstract types

<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">Structural subtyping aka duck typing</summary>

So far we have looked at concrete types, such as integers, strings and lists. These types are expressive, you know exactly what you are working with. But, often these concrete types limit design. Take for instance this function:


    def sum(items: list[int]) -> int:
        total = 0
        for item in items:
            total += item
        return item


There is no reason this implementation cannot work with other types of data structures. A tuple of integers or a set of integers should work just fine, but the type hint `list[int]` will only accept a concrete `list`. This is quite un-pythonic!

Looking at the implementation of `sum`, all that is needed from `items` is that it works with a for-loop. Or more precisely, the data structure needs to be iterable. 

We could say that we only care about a property of the type of data structure, namely that it is iterable. We are not not necessarily interested in the concrete thing. Rather, if the type we insert into the function is somewhat list-like, the function should work just fine. In comes duck typing:

> if it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck... it's a duck.

We need a type that can swim, or in our case a data structure that is iterable. Whether that happens to be a swimming duck or a swimming fish in the end, that is irrelevant here. Luckily Python's `typing` module comes with a bunch of "duck types" built-in, one of which is `Iterable` that we can use like so:


    from typing import Iterable

    def sum(items: Iterable[int]) -> int:
        total = 0
        for item in items:
            total += item
        return item


Now any calls to `sum`, whether that'd be with a `tuple` or `set`, will all pass type checks. As all of these data structures are iterable! This form of abstract types is called structural subtyping. Alternatively, and probably easier to remember: **static duck typing**. This is done through creating a subtype that only contains some structural aspect of the original type. For instance, `Iterable` is a subtype with only the method `__iter__` (Python's hidden method for iterable things). So as long as the actual type implements `__iter__` any type check will pass.

The `typing` module provides more duck types, most notably: `Sequence` and `Mapping`. `Sequence` is a duck type for anything that keeps an order and is index-able. Lists and tuples are `Sequence`s, but a `set` for instance is not.


    from typing import Sequence

    a: Sequence[int] = [1, 2, 3]  # All good
    b: Sequence[int] = (1, 2, 3)  # All good
    c: Sequence[int] = {1, 2, 3}  # Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Set[int]", variable has type "Sequence[int]")


`Mapping` is a generic type for structures that map one value to another, such as dictionaries for instance.


    from typing import Mapping

    a: Mapping[str, int] = {"foo": 1}  # All good


<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">For the technically curious...</summary>

These abstract data types are implemented as so called `Protocols`. See this [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/). Through these Protocols you can define your own duck types too. For instance:


    from typing import Iterable, Protocol

    class SupportsAdd(Protocol):
        def __add__(self, other):
            pass

    def sum(items: Iterable[SupportsAdd]) -> SupportsAdd:
        total = None
        for item in items:
            if total is None:
                total = item
            else:
                total += item
        return item

    sum([1, 2, 3]) # all good
    sum([1.5, None]) # error: List item 1 has incompatible type "None"; expected "SupportsAdd"


</details>

4. Annotate the code below with duck types instead:


        T = TypeVar("T")

        def reverse(items: list[T]) -> list[T]:
            new = []
            for item in items:
                new.insert(0, item)
            return new


    <textarea name="form[q4.1]" rows="5" required=""></textarea>


        T = TypeVar("T")

        def select(items: list[T], indices: list[int]) -> list[T]:
            selection = []
            for index in indices:
                selection.append(items[index])
            return selection

    
    <textarea name="form[q4.2]" rows="5" required=""></textarea>



        T = TypeVar("T")

        def filter(items: list[T], allowed: dict[T, bool]) -> list[T]:
            new = []
            for item in items:
                if allowed[item]:
                    new.append(item)
            return new


    <textarea name="form[q4.3]" rows="6" required=""></textarea>

<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">Nominal subtyping aka subclassing </summary>

Duck typing is great and all, but what if we actually do want a duck, not something that happens to act like a duck. For instance, let's say we are building a grading app and we have three user roles, `Teacher`, `Assistant` and `Student`. Implemented like so:


    class User:

    class Staff(User): pass

    class Teacher(Staff): pass

    class Assistant(Staff): pass

    class Student(User): pass


Through this we can write functions that only accept specific types of users. For instance:


    def view_grade(user: User) -> int: pass
    def add_grade(user: Staff) -> None: pass


This way the type checker will allow all three roles to view grades, but only the `Staff` roles can add a grade. This form of abstract types is called nominal subtyping, where that type or any subclass of that type is accepted.

<details markdown="1"><summary  markdown="span">Special types</summary>

There are some special cases that need special treating and you'll find these in the `typing` module! [Here are the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#special-forms)

#### Union

For instance, in some cases a function might be able to cope with multiple types. Effectively one type or the other. `Union` handles this like so:


    from typing import Union

    def add(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]:
        return a + b


> Starting in Python 3.10, `Union[int, float]` can also be written as `int | float`

#### Optional

Sometimes it is uncertain whether a function will return a value. Let's say we are looking for the location of a needle in a haystack. It might be in the haystack, it might also not be. In case it is not, it is a common (not necessarily best) practice to return `None`. That is what `Optional` captures, either a value is returned, or `None`.


    from typing import Optional, Sequence, TypeVar

    T = TypeVar("T")

    def find_index(haystack: Sequence[T], needle: T) -> Optional[int]:
        for i, hay in enumerate(haystack):
            if hay == needle:
                return i
        return None


> `Optional[int]` is equivalant to `Union[int, None]`. In that sense, it is entirely optional to use.

#### Callable

Functions can be passed to other functions too. That is what `Callable` captures in Python.

    from typing import Callable

    def get_hashes(number: int) -> str:
        return "#" * number

    def get_stars(number: int) -> str:
        return "*" * number

    def create_pyramid(create_layer: Callable[[int], str], height) -> str:
        pyramid = ""
        for i in range(1, height + 1):
            pyramid += create_layer(i) + "\n"
        return pyramid

    print(create_pyramid(get_hashes, 5))
    print(create_pyramid(get_stars, 5))


</details>

5. Annotate the code below:

    
        def get(items, index):
            if index >= len(items):
                return None
            return items[index]
    

    <textarea name="form[q5.1]" rows="4" required=""></textarea>

    
        import time

        def pick_one(a, b):
            time_in_milliseconds: int = int(time.time() * 1000)
            if time_in_milliseconds % 2 == 0:
                return a
            return b 
    
    
    <textarea name="form[q5.2]" rows="5" required=""></textarea>

    
        def map(function, items):
            results = []
            for item in items:
                result = function(item)
                results.append(result)
            return results
    

    <textarea name="form[q5.3]" rows="6" required=""></textarea>


## mypy

Install `mypy` through pip like so:


    $ pip3 install mypy


> Depending on your installation, you might need to use `pip3` instead, or `python -m pip`.

Once installed, run mypy like so:


    $ mypy my_program.py


Or to type check all python files, use shell globbing or pass a directory instead.


    $ mypy *.py
    $ mypy .


To check your answers to the questions above, simply paste them in a Python file and run `mypy` on it. When doing so, be sure to pass in various inputs to the various functions. You can also make use of `reveal_type` to show what type mypy thinks a variable is. Read more about this feature in [the mypy docs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common_issues.html?highlight=reveal_type#reveal-type).
