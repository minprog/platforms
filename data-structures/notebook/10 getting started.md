# Jupyter Notebooks

For this assignment there will be a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
which you should use to answer some short questions about the material. These
notebooks allow a mixture of nicely formatted text, *Python* code and some
tests.

<!-- First, you should use the `conda` option option to install *Jupyter* too:

    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

If you didn't install *Python* using *Anaconda*, follow the *Jupyter* installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install). -->

Download the notebook file for this assignment [here](notebook/module_5_questions.ipynb)
(right-click and save).

<!-- ## Getting Started

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you placed the file for the
assignment and run the command

    jupyter notebook

This will print some information about the *Notebook* server in your console,
and open a web browser to the URL of the web application. By default this is
[http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888). **Note that _127.0.0.1_ is the "home" ip-adress, so this is now a webpage running on your own computer!**

This first page shows the dashboard, which lists the notebooks available in the
current directory. You can create new notebooks from the dashboard with the
`New` button (select *Python 3* notebook), or open existing ones. Creating a
new notebook will create a new file `Untitled1.ipynb`. The extension `.ipynb`
indicates it is a notebook file, you can rename the file to something more
descriptive at the top of the page. -->


## Complexity Questions

<!-- Now open the downloaded notebook *module_5_questions.ipynb* by navigating to
the correct folder in your webbrowser and selecting the file. The rest of the
assignment instructions will be in the notebook. -->

Start by reading the part about *Notebook cells* and *Markdown*. Next, answer
the questions on the *Efficiency* section (which was the first part of this
module) and write your answers in the code cells there.

For each of the sections in Part 1, 2 and 3 of this module there will some
corresponing question you should answer in the notebook. After completing a
section, answer the question in the notebook and check your answers, before
moving on to the next section.
