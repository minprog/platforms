# Pandas

In this assignment you'll be learning how to use the Pandas library for loading, manipulating, visualizing and storing data.

Pandas is one of the most practical ways to deal with data in Python.

## Jupyter Notebooks

For this assignment there will be a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter notebook provides a programming environment in your browser.
As you will discover, notebooks provide a neat way to experiment with small codes fragments without having to immediately write a full program.

It also allows to alternate code with text and explanation. The exercises will be integrated into the notebook for this assignment.

## Installing Jupyter (if needed)

        pip install notebook

Or follow the *Jupyter* installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).


## Download assignment

Download the Jupyter notebook assignment here: [pandas.zip](../code/pandas.zip)
(right-click and save).

Unpack the zip file into an appropriate directory.

## Getting Started

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the zip file for the
assignment and run the command

    jupyter notebook

This will print some information about the *Notebook* server in your console,
and automatically open a web browser to the URL of the web application.

## Complexity Questions

Now open the notebook called *pandas.ipynb* by navigating to
the correct folder in your web-browser and selecting the file. The rest of the
assignment instructions will be in the notebook.
