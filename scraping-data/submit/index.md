# Submit

Here you can submit your solutions to the problems in your module. Take note:

- You must submit a number of files for quick inspection, but also a **zipfile** so we can download and run your programs more easily.

    - The zipfile must contain not only your python code, but also generated .csv and .png files

- Ensure that all programs have the right name. For example, when submitting `prime.py`, a files named `prime (1).py` or `primetest2.py` will not be accepted!

- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline. However, each time you submit, you need to submit all problems at once.

- In case of problems submitting, ask your teacher or send an e-mail to <scientific@uva.nl>.
